Gotta thank Hamza and Jalesia for looking over my code and seeing what I was missing while I was sick. 
They took their time despite me sounding like I was dying and having my two brain cells rub together.
Also, a nice shout out to Christian. Thanks for walking me through it right before I got sick despite 
us literally working on two different parts of the code. Your simple explantions help me put things 
together on my own. I just needed to fix my logic.
